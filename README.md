# Financial Data Analysis

Goal: combine data from various sources (such as social media, financial news, and user sentiments) to predict return and evaluate risk.

## Trading

Two very important measures: **Sharpe Ratio** and **Maximum Drawdown**.

Notebooks:
1. Create trading signals using moving averages
2. Implement trend-following strategy
3. Model stock return and measure financial risk when investing
4. Estimate the confidence interval for the return of stocks or equity funds
5. Validate assertion or specific claims (e.g. from fund managers) about investment returns 

> "Distributions of daily and monthly stock returns are rather symmetric about their means , but the tails are fatter (i.e. there are more outliers) than would be expected with normal distributions"

By Fama and French.
